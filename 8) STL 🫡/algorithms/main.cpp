/*
Algorithms in STL:
The C++ Standard Template Library (STL) includes a wide range of algorithms that operate on various container types (such as vectors, lists, sets, and maps)
and provide essential functionality for data manipulation. These algorithms are defined in the <algorithm> header and are part of the STL's core functionality.
